# Fractals
The intent of this repo is to make fractals, that are generalized from common patterns and are fully customizable. 

Currently there are two fractals, see sample outputs in each for some things they can do. Currently the fractals are in need of a better color scheme. 
## Koch snowflake
A fully customizable Koch Snowflake

## Sierpinski Carpet
A modified version of Sierpinski's Carpet. It has been generalized to all regular polygons, but does not yet support the corners yet. (For other polygons, it will be generated from center to corner + dist)
