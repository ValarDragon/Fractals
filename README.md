# Koch_Snowflake
This makes a Koch_Snowflake with every component being customizable, even the scaling factor.

# Fractals
The intent of this repo is to make fractals, that are generalized from common patterns and are fully customizable. 

Currently there are two, a fully customizable Koch Snowflake, and a modified rendition of Sierpinski's Carpet
