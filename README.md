# Fractals
The intent of this repo is to make fractals, that are generalized from common patterns and are fully customizable.

Currently there are two fractal types, see sample outputs in each for some things they can do. Currently the fractals are in need of a better color scheme. 
## Koch snowflake
A fully customizable Koch Snowflake

## Sierpinski Carpet
A fully customizable Sierpinski's Carpet, it has been generalized to all regular polygons.
